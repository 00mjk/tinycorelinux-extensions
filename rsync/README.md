# Rsync module for building 64 bit tcl extension

## Building
This directory holds everything I used to build rsync on a TCL machine.  Specifically I used the 
boot2docker 1.7.0 iso as my base development box.

When compiling I set the environment variables in `BUILD_VARIABLES` and had the packages in
`tce-status` installed.

I followed the build instructions [here](http://wiki.tinycorelinux.net/wiki:creating_extensions here).
