# tinycorelinux-extensions
Repo holding tiny core linux extensions and their build environments.

This repo uses docker to create a TCL dev environment that can build
extensions.  The dev images can be found in `dev-images`.  There is a generic
one just for compiling and then an extension that has the additional submission
and testing tools installed.
